      <p>
        To celebrate the launch of the new docs and, more importantly, to
        clearly separate the old and the new content, we’ve moved to the shorter
        react.dev domain. The old reactjs.org domain will now redirect here. The
        old React docs are now archived at legacy.reactjs.org.
      </p>
      <p>
        All existing links to the old content will automatically redirect there
        to avoid “breaking the web”, but the legacy site will not get many more
        updates. Believe it or not, React will soon be ten years old. In
        JavaScript years, it’s like a whole century! We’ve refreshed the React
        homepage to reflect why we think React is a great way to create user
        interfaces today, and updated the getting started guides to more
        prominently mention modern React-based frameworks. If you haven’t seen
        the new homepage yet, check it out!
